# PromptCAD: AI-Powered Schematic Engine

PromptCAD is an experimental text-to-schematic engineering tool powered by Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro. It converts natural language circuit descriptions into professional, exportable SVG diagrams using a custom auto-routing engine.

Simply describe a circuit—"A common emitter amplifier with NPN transistor" or "A full adder using logic gates"—and watch it generate instantly.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Natural Language Processing**: Uses Gemini 3.0 Pro to understand complex engineering prompts.
*   **Vector Rendering**: High-performance SVG generation with a custom Manhattan routing algorithm.
*   **Component Library**: Supports resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, LEDs, BJTs, MOSFETs, Op-Amps, and digital logic gates.
*   **Exportable**: Download your designs as clean SVG files for documentation or further editing.
*   **Real-time Code View**: See the JavaScript code generated by the AI to understand how the schematic is constructed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Model**: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview via `@google/genai` SDK
*   **Rendering**: Custom SVG engine (`TechDrawEngine`)
